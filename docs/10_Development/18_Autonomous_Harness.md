# Autonomous harness — the one way to launch, drive, and prove (EPIC #154 / #459)

**Status:** Active
**Category:** Development

This is the **single documented path** for any agent (or human) that needs Assetto Corsa
driven autonomously and evidence collected — testing car setups, verifying a dashboard,
exercising voice coaching, capturing telemetry. Do **not** write throwaway `.scratch` drivers;
compose on this harness. (Repo skill pointer: `.claude/skills/ac-harness/SKILL.md`.)

## The one command

```bash
python -m tools.ac_harness.auto_drive \
    --car ks_porsche_911_gt3_r_2016 --track spa \
    --setup Realistic_BB_v3 --driver ggv --wait-lap
```

That single command owns the whole loop:

1. **Preflight** — content installed, CSP `[CUSTOM_AI] ENABLED=1`, Content Manager present,
   setup resolvable, preset↔CLI combo consistency. Fails fast with an actionable message
   (`--preflight-only` runs just this gate).
2. **Sidecar** — reuses a listening sidecar (e.g. the Game Point launcher's supervised child on
   `:8765`); auto-starts a loopback `tools.ai_sidecar` otherwise (`--no-sidecar-autostart` to
   forbid; `--keep-sidecar` to leave it running).
3. **Deterministic launch** — with `--car`, a pinned practice `.cmpreset` is generated (clear
   weather, 26 °C, 12:00, optimum track — the #154 determinism-lock preset) and launched via the
   de-elevated Content Manager URL, with relaunch retries on the menu-skip race.
   Hand-authored presets: `--cm-preset <file>` (the preflight cross-checks its CarId/TrackId).
4. **Setup applied AND verified** — `--setup <name>` resolves under
   `Documents/Assetto Corsa/setups/<car>/<track|generic>/`, is applied in-sim through the
   sidecar `setup.load` relay (`ac.loadSetup`, pits gate), and the run **fails at
   `stage="setup"`** unless the in-sim ack names the requested setup. Setup runs spawn in the
   pit box (`StartType=PIT`); plain runs spawn at the start line.
5. **Drive** — `--driver ggv` (flat-out friction-circle min-time), `racing` (AI-line pace,
   default), or `cruise` (slow lane-keeper). Guards: sim-death detection, a **no-progress
   watchdog** (recovers stalls regardless of throttle), a **recovery cap** (default 6) that fails
   honestly with the stall location, and spawn-to-line teleport for pit-box starts
   (`--no-spawn-line` to disable).
6. **Assert** — taps the sidecar WS and asserts the live producer contract
   (`connection`/`tire_temps`/`coaching.snapshot`; `--wait-lap` additionally requires a completed
   lap; `--strict` enforces session→lap ordering).
7. **Evidence bundle** — everything a downstream task needs to *prove* its outcome.

## Evidence contract

Default bundle: `.scratch/harness-evidence/<utc>_<car>_<track>/` (override `--evidence-dir`):

| Artifact | Content |
|---|---|
| `report.json` | Full `AutoDriveReport` (pass/fail + stage, combo, `setup_requested/applied` + in-sim ack, drive stats incl. `recoveries`/`spawn_teleport`, WS frame counts) plus run extras: preset used, sidecar provenance, HUD verdict, lap-archive paths |
| `generated.cmpreset` | The exact preset launched (when generated) |
| `hud.png` | Post-run HUD capture (`--hud-region full|left|coaching`) with liveness verdict |
| `lap_archives` (in report.json) | Paths of `journal/laps/lap_*.json` written during the run — full telemetry traces for session review / setup comparison |

Bundles live under `.scratch/` — **session ephemera**. A consuming task promotes what it must
keep (reference archives, curated comparisons) to a durable location; never treat the bundle as
long-term storage (scratch-dir disposability pitfall).

## Composing downstream tasks (don't reinvent)

- **Setup A/B**: run twice with different `--setup` names; compare the runs' lap archives with
  `python -m tools.session_review` (see `17_Session_Review.md`) or `setup.compare` frames.
- **Dashboard / HUD verification**: use the drive as the live signal source; assert on
  `hud.png` + your own captures while the run holds the car on track.
- **Voice coaching**: run with the sidecar voice enabled; the WS tap counts in `report.json`
  prove the advisory stream flowed while the car drove.
- **Reference laps / TT comparison**: `--wait-lap` guarantees at least one archived lap;
  feed it to `tools.tt_ingest` / session review with `--reference-source tt`.

## Troubleshooting (hard-won rig lore — read before debugging)

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Preflight `custom_ai` failure | Set `[CUSTOM_AI] ENABLED=1` in `<AC root>/extension/config/new_behaviour.ini` (user `cfg/extension/new_behaviour.ini` overrides when it carries the key) |
| CM clicks/launch do nothing | **Foreground steal**: minimize the agent/terminal window; AC's fullscreen menu covers CM — the harness kills stale `acs.exe` before each launch |
| "Steam API failed to initialize" | Steam elevation mismatch — restart Steam **non-elevated** (`steam -shutdown`, relaunch via `explorer.exe`) |
| `setup.load` error "no loopback Lua peer connected" | The trainer app isn't (yet) connected to the sidecar — the harness retries for `setup_timeout`; persistent = app not installed/enabled in CSP |
| Run FAILS with `recovery cap exceeded at <N>m` | Real stall: the car repeatedly stopped at the same spot. Inspect `hud.png` + the stall distance; do **not** raise the cap to make it "pass" |
| Two agents, one rig | **Yield**: a single AC instance cannot serve two autonomous sessions (see the issue-277 investigation). Check for a running `acs.exe`/peer sidecar before launching |
| Sidecar port already in use | That's usually the Game Point launcher's supervised sidecar — the harness reuses it; don't spawn a second |

## Layers underneath (when you need less than the full loop)

`auto_drive` composes the primitives; they remain individually usable:
`entry_launcher` (launch only) · `custom_ai` (carcsw actuation) · `sequence_probe` (WS assert
only, `--skip-launch` style) · `hud_capture` (render liveness) · `self_test` (producer contract
without motion) · `daemon` (persistent rig service with `/session/start`).
